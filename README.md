Challenges: Timing, I still feel like I needed more time to finish and I wasn't able to complete all the requirements in a timely manner. I felt like certain things went well but I always have a few issues making the retrofit call which was the last thing before I threw in my towel. I did have a major headache so that wasn't great. But overall I don't think the requirements were too bad
